# Debugging and Troubleshooting

#### first of all, I will check the logs in storage/logs/laravel.log and find error messages related to the 500 error.
#### I would simulate creating task under various conditions like with valid and invalid data. If certain required fields are not properly validated, it could cause 500 error.
#### I will check database. If there are any issues like missing columns or constraints, this could cause 500 error. I will also check database connection and configuration.
#### By using try-catch blocks, I will review the error handling in the code.
#### After fixing it, I will test it and also write unit test.
